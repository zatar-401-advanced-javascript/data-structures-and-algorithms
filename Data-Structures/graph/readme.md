# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Approach & Efficiency
Using map

## API
* AddNode() : Adds a new node to the graph
* AddEdge(): Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
* GetNodes(): Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection 
* GetNeighbors(): Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
* Size(): Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
